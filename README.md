Android RMB Emulator for Godot

Tldr - ALT+LMB = RMB Made simply because android does not handle right mouse presses that well, treating them like 'back button' presses on some devices and ignoring them on others. This is a simple script/addon to make godot for android actually usable on android. Should support both simple clicking as well as click-dragging with RMB, edit the code to do whatever, its not that hard and you probably could've written this yourself :D
